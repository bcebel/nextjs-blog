This challenge was to use a third party API, in this case OpenWeather, to create a weather app that creates a forecast based on a location. This is all front end using html dependencies and api requests within the js code. Getting the formatting done using bootstrap was one of the bigger challenges on this one. It also keeps a record of recent searches from local storage. Figuring out time-zones and locations was also a challenge, it converts the town and city data into coordinates using their geocoding api.
