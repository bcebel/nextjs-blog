Phudi was our second group project. The idea was to create a reservation system for a restaurant.

The exercize was to use the Model, View, Controller method of developing a site. We also used an email generator to create a reservation confirmation. 


We used Express, REST routes, SQL queries and session ID to manage the data flow.  We deployed to Heroku and used MYSQL Workbench to access the deployed database.   

**Technologies Used**

- bcrypt
- bootstrap
- dotenv
- express-handlebars
- express-session
- heroku
- mysql2
- nodemailer
- mailgen
- sequelize

We used bootstrap for the design.
