Quiz Wars was a solo project in week four of bootcamp.  It is vanilla javascript, all in one JavaScript file with an HTML page and some CSS.  It was a great exercise to learn dom manipulation.  Now that I have graduated bootcamp I'm sort of impressed that this is all done with one file.  Its a good reminder that at the end of the day all of the most complex frameworks boil down to code one way or another.  

- **Vanilla Javascript for the win**

At the time I was struggling to get this assignment to work, it uses local storage to keep track of scores and null values were giving me a difficult time, not only that this is the week I got Covid again.  I got stuck numerous times but I eventually figured out a game plan.  I learned a lot about logic flow and how **NOT to do it!**

I did have fun researching Star Wars fonts and color schemes!
