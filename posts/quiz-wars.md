Quiz Wars was a solo project in week four of bootcamp. It was a great exercise to learn dom manipulation. Now that I have graduated bootcamp I'm sort of impressed that this is all done with one file. Its a good reminder that at the end of the day that a few lines of code can do big things.

This was the week i got covid again but my class mates cheered me up and then we killed it on the first group project. I fought a battle against a null value but I eventually conquered it lol.

I also had fun researching Star Wars fonts and color schemes!
