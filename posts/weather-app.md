Hot 10 was our first group project. It uses the YouTube API and Last FM's API. If you search for a band it will populate the 10 most viewed youtube videos by them, and underneath it will populate 10 album covers.

It didn't use much in terms of frameworks it was just putting our heads down and writing code from scratch.

- Vanilla Javascript
- Fetch Requests
- CSS
- HTML
- Google AMP

We wanted it to have a 90s theme, think myspace era, so the design choices were in fact intentional, especially the **animated fire**
It was a challenge but it was a lot of fun as well. Our team was amazing and we kept eachother laughing the **entire** time.
