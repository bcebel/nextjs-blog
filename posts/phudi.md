Phudi was our second group project. The idea was to create a reservation system for a restaurant.

We used Express, SQL and Sequelize to get this project done. The exercize was to use the Model, View, Controller method of developing a site. We also used an email generator to create a reservation confirmation.

It utilizes a login using a session ID.  

**Technologies Used**

- bcrypt
- bootstrap
- dotenv
- express-handlebars
- express-session
- mysql2
- nodemailer
- mailgen
- sequelize

We used bootstrap for the design.
